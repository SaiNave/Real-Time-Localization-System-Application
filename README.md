# UWB Real-Time-Localization-System UI
- This repository contains the project details Healthcare UWB RTLS UI performance.
- Healthcare UWB RTLS UI stands for Healthcare Ultra wide Band Real time localization system user interface. 
- This UI has implement on .NET Framework platform using C# Winform application. 

### What is Real-time localization system (RTLS)?
Real time localization system (RTLS) is a technology solution that automatically identify and track the location of objects or people in real time, in most cases with in a building such as ware house, shipping yard, hospital, or campus. 
RTLS consisting of three main components: Mobile Tags, Fixed Anchors and the Control PC (with User interface) at the end. 

### What is RTLS UI?
RTLS–UI is the end component of the RTLS system. It’s a visual application which gives the system distinctive “look” and “feel” for the user to manipulates the information in 2D or 3D graphics display. The information processed by the User Interface is mainly based on the object’s position coordinates received from the localization algorithm. 

### Why it's called as UWB RTLS UI?
Because this whole RTLS systems employed UWB (ultra wide band) sensors system for gathering the location information of moving objects or humans to visualize and analyze on user interface panel. Figure1 shows the main setup for UWB RTLS. <br />

### Purpose of developing UI:
The purpose of developing this UI is to track and visualize the activites and movements of dementia patients in nursing home.
The information received by UI through UWB sensor Network deployed at nursing home
